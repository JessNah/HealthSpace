# Health Space
Monitor and stay on top of your symptoms, get insights into how your symptoms are progressing, and get the latest health advice. Take care of yourself the best way you can.

Health Space was created during the Corona Virus panic of 2020, in hopes of helping the population mitigate some of its adverse impacts.

## Inspiration
We've heard stories of so many people in our lives who have been having fevers, or headaches, or even a slightly sore throat, and the first fear that comes to their minds is "what if they have the virus". People are too scared to even tell their doctor that they have a sore throat, and people don't know what medication to take or how long these symptoms might last.

We created HeadSpace - an app to help take care of everyone at home, who are either suffering from mild-moderate symptoms, or simply do not have access to medical support.

## What it does
Head Space is a mobile application where users can:

View quick links to medical resources and videos.
Get live statistics on the global status of Covid19
Log their own symptoms and pain levels
Get insights into how their symptoms are progressing, what medications they have tried and what has worked, and more.
Find out how many others have been experiencing similar symptoms and how long it took them to recover.
Get a better understanding of what relief methods have worked on a personal individual level.
Export a detailed report which can be provided to the Hospital or emailed to your doctor.
An easy to use UI keeps things simple and the app includes a friendly welcoming theme to help keep users calm.

## How we built it
We primarily used React-Native, and Node.js for the development of this project.

## Challenges we ran into
We saw the notice for this Hackathon on the 26th, and were only able to begin working on it on the 27th(early evening - after work), that left us 2.5 days to come up with an idea, and make a prototype. This was very challenging but we were proud to make not just one, but two different solutions!
It was hard developing together and communicating our ideas and brain storming back and forth whilst being apart (maintaining social distancing). We managed to make do by practically living in a share-screen call (Next-Level pair programming).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Using primarily React-Native for our solution, we were very proud of how quickly we were able to keep up with the new language when we had both never had prior experience with it. We were proud of our solution and hope that we might be able to contribute some positive impact during this time.

## What we learned
Sleep is unnecessary. We learnt a new language and new technologies during the development of this project. We also learnt to make-do with distance brainstorming and development - share screens, live docs

## What's next for Health Space
At the moment the prototype/solution brings the benefits of helping users maintain a log of their symptoms and better understand what reliefs have been helping them. They can gain insights into how their symptoms have progress, gain a detailed summary, and even view quick readily available valuable resources related to the crisis.

There is so much more that this app could do.

We are excited to continue with the development of Health Space, next steps include creating a back-end to store all the data collected with consent by the users. This data could prove to be invaluable towards helping health professionals, scientists, and government workers to discover solutions to recommend to patients at home trying to manage their symptoms. They would gain better insights into the true number of cases affected by corona-virus, and how many are false positives. The data collected could also help us to better understand how long do the symptoms last for most patients and how long does it take till they recover.
